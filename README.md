# PasswordGenerator

## Description

The aim of this project was to make a portfolio to display my future projects as a web developer. This was done through creating different sections for each part of my portfolio and creating boxes to display future work. In this project, I got a lot more practice using CSS flexbox and grid. I also got better with using media queries.
